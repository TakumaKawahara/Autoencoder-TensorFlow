# Autoencoder-TensorFlow

Udacity Deep Learning Foundation Nanodegree Program(DLND)
Part.3 Convolutional Networks Lesson about Autoencoder.  

This is my solution for Udacity DLND project about Autoencoder.
<https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning/tree/master/autoencoder>  
  
While provided solutions from Udacity use "tensorflow.layers" to construct deep neural network,  
my solutions use "tensorflow.nn".
